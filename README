Doorknob is an SMTP (mail) forwarder that is dumb as a doorknob. All
the smarts are in libcurl (https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/).

Doorknob is meant to be used on machines where you want to forward all
of the mail to one mail account. Example use cases are laptops where
you want to forward all your mail to say gmail no matter who it is
really for. Or routers. Or work machines with overly strict email
policies :(

Doorknob has one simple config file and comes with a sample file that
is fairly well documented. All mail goes to the One True Server
(smtp-server) from the One True User (mail-from). Doorknob can even
overwrite the From: in the header for those overly strict work
policies.

If the recipient has an @ in the email (fred@gmail.com) then the
address goes through unchanged. However if the recipient is local
(root) then it is send to the One True User. This means all your cron
output gets sent to the right place.

Hint: It is recommended that HOSTNAME be set with the fully qualified
      host name.


Validation and Security
-----------------------

Doorknob is not very bright. A basic assumption is that you are
sending to a commercial grade mail server which will already be doing
a lot of (too much?) checking and filtering of the email. So doorknob
lets them do that job and just does as little as possible. Maybe
doorknob isn't as dump as he looks.


How It Works
------------

You can safely skip this section. You only need this if you want to
interface with doorknob directly.

I am going to assume the defaults here.

Doorknob watches the /var/spool/mail/queue directory for new files and
then sends them. You should create the file somewhere else
(/var/spool/mail/tmp is used by sendmail) and then move it into the
queue directory.

The file name doesn't really matter as long as it isn't a hidden
file. The recommended format is <seconds>.<microseconds>.<getpid>.
This should guarantee no collisions (except over NFS).

The format of the file is:

<raw from address>
<raw to address>
<more raw to addressii ...>
<empty line>
<stuff>

A raw address is fred@gmail.com, not <fred@gmail.com> and certainly
not Fred Flintstone <fred@gmail.com>.

Seriously, unless rewriting the From: line, doorknob doesn't care what
comes after the empty line.


Ubuntu Warning
--------------

Of course Ubuntu has to be the problem child. The default mail program
is evil and uses "sendmail -t". Since I don't support this option
right now, you either need to look elsewhere (maybe nullmailer?) or do
an "apt install s-nail".
